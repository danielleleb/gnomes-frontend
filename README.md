# Description

This app displays all the information of all gnomes. All users are able to view the names and profile pictures of all of the gnomes, but only logged in users can view friends and professions.

All of the gnomes are listed on the landing page as a list. Each gnomes profile can be viewed by clicking on their profile picture or name. The selected gnome's profile then appears in a modal. Users are requested to log in to view full information. After logging in (or signing up), users are then redirected back to the landing/search page. 

All searching is done through a pipe on the frontend, rather than through the backend to help decrease loading and reloading time.
